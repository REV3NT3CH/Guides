1.) First download source and what branch you want which is found here: https://github.com/pfactum/pf-kernel
    and extract it to /home directory

    Note: to build with a custom toolchain do the following

	Step 1.) download 5.2 chain from here http://sabermod.com/Toolchains%20%28DEV%20ONLY%29/x86_64/
		 and extract it to /home directory
	Step 2.) in kernels make change CROSS_COMPILE    ?= $(CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE:"%"=%)
		 to CROSS_COMPILE    := /home/rev3nt3ch/x86_64-linux-gnu-5.2/bin/x86_64-

    Note 2: Change username (ex. rev3nt3ch) to match your own linux username as well as toolchain name (ex. x86_64-linux-gnu-5.2)
            to whichever you downloaded. the above is just an example of how i do it.  

2.) Open up a terminal in the directory of downloaded and extracted kernel and enter the following:

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

    and press enter

    sudo cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config

    and press enter

3.) In same terminal run enter the following and select which configs you want:

    make oldconfig

    and press enter

    (if you dont know what to select just press enter and it will select default for you)

4.) Once that is completed enter the following in same terminal:

    sudo time make -j13 deb-pkg

    and press enter

    (the -j13 flag is what jobs i have set because thats how many threads my cpu allows)

5.) Once this is completed the .deb files created from the build will be placed one folder up from the kernels source directory.
    With how i directed this setup they should be in the /home directory. Open a terminal cd'd into the directory they are all in
    and enter the following:

    sudo dpkg --force-all -i *.deb

    and press enter

6.)Thats it! now is the recommended time to reboot to bootup and enjoy the new kernel.
